## Overview

This repository contains my contribution to the [Summer 2021 - Shopify
Developer Intern
Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKRywXQLZWOqVOHC4JkF3LqdpO3Llpfk_CkZPR8bjak/edit).
The task was to build an image repository.

I decided to build a web application with the framework
[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) for the R programming language. To
prove the capabilities of my application I crawled over 30,000 images of
historical paintings from the [Web Gallery of Art](https://www.wga.hu/).
Users can collect these paintings and trade them with other users.
