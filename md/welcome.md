## Login and Users

Users may log in using the interface in the upper-right corner. Every user has a unique user name and a password. For demonstration 100 random users exist. Their user names can be seen in the tab *User Table*. For convenience the user password is the first name of a user starting with a lower case letter. There is one admin account with user name `Admin` and password `admin`.

That's all you need to know to start your journey. Enjoy browsing!
