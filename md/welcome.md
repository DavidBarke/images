## Login and Users

Users may log in using the interface in the upper-right corner. Every user has a unique user name and a password. For demonstration 100 random users exist. Their user names can be seen in the tab *User Table*. For convenience the user password is the first name of a user starting with a lower case letter. There is one admin account with user name `Admin` and password `admin`.

## User Status

There are two user statuses:

* `user` : Collects and trades images and has an account balance. 
* `admin` : Conducts user management and can view every table of the database.

## Paintings

Paintings are taken from the [Web Gallery of Art](https://www.wga.hu/). 

---

A `user` has three different views for paintings:

* **Browse** : View all paintings in the database.
* **Collection** : View own paintings.
* **Buy** : View all paintings offered by other users.

She can offer their images for sale in the **Collection** view.

An `admin` has only one view (**Browse**) for paintings as she can't own paintings.
